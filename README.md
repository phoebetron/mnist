# mnist

Publicly available MNIST CSV dataset as provided by [Kaggle], which in turn came
from [Joseph Redmon]. The `mnist_train.csv` file contains the 60,000 training
examples and labels. The `mnist_test.csv` contains 10,000 test examples and
labels. Each row consists of 785 values: the first value is the label (a number
from 0 to 9) and the remaining 784 values are the pixel values (a number from 0
to 255).
